1.  stdint.h is a library that implements integers of certain byte-lengths and signed/unsigned, rather than a standard int.

2.  Using these specific integer types ensures we can use unsigned integers of the correct length, corresponding with BYTE, DWORD,
    LONG, WORD in the specification.

3.  BYTE    - 1
    DWORD   - 4
    LONG    - 4 (signed)
    WORD    - 2

4.  0x4d42

5.  bfSize - The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize - The number of bytes required by the structure.

6.  If biHeight is negative the file is a top-down bitmap with the origin in the left-upper corner.
    If biHeight is positive the file is a bottom-up bitmap with the origin in the lower-left corner.

7.  biBitCount determines the bits-per-pixel, a.k.a. color depth

8.  If the file to be copied does not exist (or cannot be opened) and the file to copy to can not be created.

9.  It denotes the number of files to be read of size <size>, we are always working with only 1 file.

10.  int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;

    bi.biWdith = 3
    sizeOf(RGBTRIPLE) = 3 (since there are three bytes)

    (4 - (3 * 3)) = 4 - 9 = - 5
    -5 % 4 = 3   because -5 / 4 = -1 -> (-5 / 4) * 4 + (-5 % 4) = -5
    3 % 4 = 3

    padding = 3

11. if 'forwards' the pointer to skip the padding.

12. It's the current position of the file pointer

Answer: It was colonel mustard with the candlestick in the library.
